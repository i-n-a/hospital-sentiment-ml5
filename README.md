## Features

- Classifies comments as **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**
- Organise comments into categories such as triage, waiting time, and staff to make an analytical graph
- An marketing dashboard to use the trained sentiment analysis in report
- An ml lab page to train another dataset in to a ml5NeuralNetwork model and download it with the vocab.
Limitation: when a model is trained in ml lab, the marketing dashboard is not being updated with the new trained model. A push to the dashboard function could be made in the future, but deployent requires node.js hosting.

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript / HTML / CSS
- ml5.js (neural network)
- GitHub Pages (optional, for hosting)
- Netlify for deployment
